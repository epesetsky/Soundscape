My soundscape poses the scene of a Pitt student who is addicted to technology. As the listener might notice, they are always checking their phone between each thing they do. When walking on Forbes, they are so busy texting that they can't look up from their phone. They bump into another student in the street, and rather than apologize, they continue to look down and text. At the end of the night, the last thing they do before bed is text on the phone and immediately when they put the phone down, they snore to sleep, as they are exhausted from such a technology-filled life.
