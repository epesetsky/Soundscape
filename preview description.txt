This preview begins at the beginning of my proposed soundscape. I decided to start here because I feel as though as I work through this project, I might fall into a different path that could slightly alter my story of the life of someone controlled by technology. 

In my preview, I begin with the sound of a clock ticking. This sound, to me, assumingly similar to others, feels stressful and almost anxious. The sound reminds me of a scene in a movie or television show where the character is inching, second by second, to get out of class. Here, it moreso sets up a setting for the audience to let them know that time is ticking. 

The sound of the ticking clock moves to the noise a Macbook makes when turning on. From one to the other, the audience might feel suspense, like the character in the soundscape was waiting by the second to turn on their computer. 

Once the laptop has turned on, quick and rushed typing can be heard. This is followed by the same sound of the clock ticking as before. This time, toward the end of the ticking clip I have overlapped a sigh, demonstrating weariness, discomfort, anxiousness, etc. 

With only about thirty seconds or so heard in my preview, I think the storyline is difficult to see. It feels very choppy, and I am torn whether I like this element of my soundscape or if I want to blend together better. The choppiness does feel very start stop start stop, and I think this could be helpful in the idea I am attempting to portray. This routine we live in of wake up, check phone, put phone down, get ready, pick up phone again, get to class, open laptop, etc. demonstrates the way in which technology controls us. We are like robots to our phones but we don't see it this way. I hope to create more sounds that tie my story to a certain place (this for me is on Pitt's campus) to make my soundscape unique.
